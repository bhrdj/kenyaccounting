I have located specific, published examples for the 2026 tax year from third-party payroll compliance sources.

According to data released by **Net Pay Kenya** and **HR Fleek**, here are the "Real-World Examples 2026" showcasing the exact input details and output calculations for three different income levels. These figures incorporate the **Year 4 NSSF rates** (effective February 2026) and the **Allowable Deduction** status for SHIF and Housing Levy.

### **Example 1: Entry Level**

### **Specific Input Details for February 2026**

The specific parameters used to generate the NSSF outputs above are based on the **NSSF Act 2013 Year 4 Schedule**, which takes effect in February 2026.

* **Lower Earnings Limit (Tier I):** KES 9,000
* **Upper Earnings Limit (Tier II):** KES 108,000 (Approx. 3x National Average Earnings)
* **Maximum Deductible Contribution:** KES 6,480 (Employee) + KES 6,480 (Employer)

These "real" inputs differ from 2025 because the Upper Earnings Limit jumps from approx. KES 72,000 to KES 108,000, capturing a larger portion of the salary for the 6% deduction.
