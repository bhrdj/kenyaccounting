# **Licensing and Legal Strategy**

This document outlines the licensing framework, copyright strategy, and attribution requirements for this open-source accounting software project.

## **1\. The License: Apache License 2.0**

We have chosen the **Apache License 2.0** for this project. This is a permissive license widely used in the enterprise and business software world (e.g., Kubernetes, Android).

### **Why this license?**

* **Commercial Friendly:** It allows legitimate businesses (accounting firms, SMEs) to use this software internally without forcing them to open-source their proprietary business data or private configurations.  
* **Patent Protection:** It includes an explicit patent grant. This protects the project and its users from patent litigation regarding contributions made to this codebase.  
* **Strict Attribution:** Unlike the MIT license, Apache 2.0 has specific clauses that protect the author's right to credit.

## **2\. Attribution Requirements**

Per Section 4 of the Apache License 2.0, **attribution is mandatory**.

If you use, modify, or distribute this software (even as part of a larger proprietary system), you strictly **must not** remove the NOTICE file located in the root of this repository.

* **The NOTICE File:** This file contains the project name and the original copyright attribution. It must be preserved in any distribution.  
* **Source Headers:** Do not remove the copyright headers at the top of individual source code files.

## **3\. Copyright Strategy (Kenya Context)**

This software is protected under the **Kenya Copyright Act (2001)** as a "Literary Work."

### **Automatic Copyright vs. Registration**

In Kenya, copyright is granted automatically the moment the code is written ("fixed"). However, formal registration with the **Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO)** is required to effectively enforce these rights in a court of law.

### **Our Registration Timeline**

To balance legal protection with the realities of agile software development, we follow this protocol:

1. **Development Phase (Current):**  
   * We rely on **Automatic Copyright**.  
   * The **Git History** of this public repository serves as our primary proof of authorship. Every commit provides a cryptographically secure, timestamped record of creation, establishing a timeline of ownership superior to any late-comer claims.  
2. **Major Milestones (v1.0 / MVP):**  
   * Upon reaching a "Minimum Viable Product" (v1.0) or significant stable release, we formally register the source code with **KECOBO** via the NRR Portal.  
   * This provides the legal certificate required for formal enforcement, covering the core logic and codebase of the application.

## **4\. For Contributors**

By contributing to this repository, you agree that your code will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0. You retain ownership of your specific contributions, but you grant the project a broad license to use and distribute them as part of the main software.
